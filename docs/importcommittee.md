# Committee Import Tool Documentation

## Overview

The `importcommittee` is a command-line application that reads a CSV file containing committee membership and meeting
attendance data and imports it into th SQLite database used by the Quorum Calculator. This tool helps to import
historical meeting data.

### CSV Format

The CSV file should be structured as follows:

| Status    | Role          | Name    | 2023-01-01 | 2023-02-01 | ... |
|-----------|---------------|---------|------------|------------|-----|
| Voter     | Voting Member | alice   | alice      | alice      | ... |
| Non-voter | Member        | bob     |            | bob        | ... |
| Voter     | Chair         | charlie | charlie    |            | ... |

- The **first three columns** represent:
    - **Initial status**: `Voter` or `Non-voter`
    - **Role**: `Voting Member`, `Member`, `Chair`, `Secretary`
    - **Name**: The username of the member
- **Remaining columns** represents meetings:
    - Header is da date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
    - Each subsequent cell lists the name of a participant if they attended the meeting.
